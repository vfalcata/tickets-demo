Ticketing App
Users can list a ticket for an event (concert, sports) for sale
Other users can purchase this ticket
Any user can list tickets for sale and purchase tickets
When a user attempts to purchase a ticket, the ticket is 'locked' for 15 minutes. The user has 15 minutes to enter their payment info
While locked, no other user can purchase the ticket. After 15 minutes, the ticket should 'unlock'
Ticket prices can be edited if they are NOT locked

Services
Auth: everything related to user signup/signin/signin
Tickets: creation/editing. Knows whether a ticket can be updated
Orders: Order creation/editing
Expiration: Watches for orders to be created, cancels them after 15 mins
Payments: Handles credit card payments. Cancels orders if payments fails, completes if payment succeeds

We are creating a separate service to manage each type of resource. So business logic is tied to a resource
An alternative is feature based design
