this directory will  have JS files inside where each file is going to export a react component
Noramally It will require React router  to set up some routing configuration inside of a JS file, but
next just works in a very different way.

In order to set up routing inside of a next project, we're going to have a very particular set of routes or
files with very particular file names inside this pages directory.

So this page folder is very important, whenever nextJS first stasrts up, its going to read all the files that we list out
inside there.

And depending upon the file names and possibly some folders that we create inside there as well, next
is going to interpret those file names as being distinct routes that we can visit inside of the application

A file named index.js will be the root route of our application, so any time we visit this application we will
get to this screen

TS would normally be beneficial to use TS, but due to the simplicity of this app, TS would require
much more work, for little benefit
