To circumvent any security risks with previous commits, this project is uploaded as a single commit as this is only a demo project exploring production ready microservices. Although it is production ready and can be deployed, it is not a production application.
---

This is a Ticketing application built with a microservice architecture. This project serves as an indepth exploration to the implementation of a production ready, deployable microservice application, hence the inline comment and notes.

It requires skaffold, docker, kubernetes, in the appropriate packages for your operating system.

In order to run this application use the command in the root directory:

```skaffold dev```
